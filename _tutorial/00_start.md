## Start

This tutorial will show you how to use Tomoko in your project. It shows the simplest example. For more in-depth explanation check the [documentation]({{site.docs[0].url}}).

In this scenario the Jackson variant is used. For Gson use GsonTomoko instead of JacksonTomoko. The rest of the tutorial is equally valid.

The complete source code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/Qubite/tomoko-tutorial).
